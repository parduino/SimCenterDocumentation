UQ: Uncertainty Quantification
==============================

The first selection panel the user must select from and enter data into is the **UQ** tab. It is in this panel where the user selects the **UQ Engine** to use for performing the uncertainty quantification calculations. Presently the **UQ Engine** option is limited to the Dakota engine.

Dakota UQ Engine
----------------

This UQ engine utilizes the `Dakota Software <https://dakota.sandia.gov/>`_, a state-of-the-art research application that is robust and provides many methods for optimization and UQ, a selection of which we utilize in this application. **Dakota** provides the user with a large number of different methods. For this reason we have divided the methods into categories though a pull-down menu, as shown in :numref:`figDakota`. Once the category has been selected, a number of different methods are made available to the user.
