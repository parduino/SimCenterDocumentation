The intended audience for the \texttt{\getsoftwarename{}} Application (\texttt{\getsoftwarename{}} App) is educators, researchers and practitioners
interested in performing finite element modeling of cyclic shear experiments of concrete shear walls. \texttt{\getsoftwarename{}}  is the acronym of shear wall intelligent modeling. 
The word ``intelligent" indicates this app is integrated with machine learning algorithms assisting users in the modeling.   \\



Given that the properties of the concrete shear wall and the loading events are known,
 \texttt{\getsoftwarename{}} provides nonlinear material models for simulating the wall behavior under cyclic loading.\\

This is an open-source research application. The source code can be found on:
