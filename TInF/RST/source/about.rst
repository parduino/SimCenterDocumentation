About TInF
===========

The intended audience for this tool is researchers and practitioners
interested in predicting the response of a structure to wind
events.

The Turbulence Inflow Tool (TInF) is designed to collect all required properties and parameters needed for various turbulence inflow models in OpenFOAM, and to augment an existing wind-around-a-building model by adding the necessary sections to respective parameter definition files.
