The user interface (UI), as shown in \Cref{fig:generic_ui}, is where the analysis
is configured and managed. Here, the user is able to provide the necessary
parameters to create the simulation, start the simulation both locally and
remotely, and view the simulation results. The interface contains several
separate areas:

\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Input Panel Selection: This area on the left side provides the
  user with a selection of items to choose from:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item UQ: the input panel for specifying everything related to Uncertainty Quantification analysis.
  \item FEM: the input panel for Finite Element model specification.
  \item RV: the input panel for the specification of random input for the problem at hand.
  \item QoI: the input panel for specifying the desired output to extract from each Finite Element simulation.
  \item RES: results tab for outputting all tables, figures, results, graphs, from the quoFEM application.  
\end{enumerate}

Selecting any of these will change the input panel presented.

\item Push Buttons: This is the area near the bottom of the UI in
  which 4 buttons are presented to the user:

\begin{enumerate}
\item RUN – Run the simulation locally on the user’s desktop machine.
\item RUN at DesignSafe – Process the information, and send to
  DesignSafe. The simulation will be run there on a supercomputer, and results
  will be stored in the user's DesignSafe jobs folder.
\item GET from DesignSafe – Obtain the list of
  jobs for the user from DesignSafe and select a job to download from that list.
\item Exit: Exit the application.
\end{enumerate}

The first 3 of the above buttons and their use are discussed in more detail in \Cref{sec:push_buttons}.

\item Login Button: The Login Button is at the top right of the UI. Before the user can launch any jobs on DesignSafe, they must
  first login to DesignSafe using their DesignSafe login and
  password. Pressing the login button will open up the login window
  for users to enter this information. Users can register for an
  account on
  the \href{https://www.designsafe-ci.org/account/register/}{DesignSafe
  webpage}.

\item Message Area: While the application is running, error and status messages will be displayed here, in the top center of the user interface.

\end{enumerate}
