Throughout the input specification the user is defining variables. As
described in the above sections many of these variables can be
specified by the user to be random variables. The UQ panel is where the user specifies the distribution of these random variables. Besides the properties of random variables, the sampling method and the number of requested samples shall also be defined by the user. The panel is split, as shown
in \Cref{fig:uq_panel}, into two frames:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Sampling Methods 
\item Random Variables
\end{enumerate}
