The final option for event definition is a user application. 
The user specifies the application name and the input file containing the specific input information 
needed by the application when it is running in the backend. 
As will be discussed later, is the user selects to utilize an application that is not provided, they are also required to edit the tools registry file. Here they must include a new event application with the same name as that entered and they must provide the location where that application can be found relative to the tools application directory. 
If running on DesignSafe, that application must be built and must be available on the Stampede2 supercomputer. 

Note: Given how DesignSafe runs the applications through Agave, the file permissions of this application must be world readable and executable.
