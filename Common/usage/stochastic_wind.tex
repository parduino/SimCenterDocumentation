This option allows users to generate synthetic wind velocity time
histories for target wind loading. In order to do so, the stochastic
wind model is selected from the drop-down menu, as shown in
\Cref{fig:stochastic_wind_loading}. Depending on the model selected, the
user will be asked to enter the parameters describing the wind loading
scenario that the synthetic time history should emulate. In the
current release, users can only select the model derived by Wittig \&
Sinha (1975) \cite{wittig1975simulation}. Additionally, users can
provide a seed for the stochastic wind generation if they desire the
same suite of synthetic time histories to be generated on multiple occasions.
If the seed is not specified, a different realization of the time
history will be generated for each run based on the input
parameters. The backend application that generates the stochastic
wind loads relies on \texttt{smelt}, a modular and extensible C++
library for generating stochastic time histories. Users interested in
learning more about the implementation and design of \texttt{smelt}
are referred to its
\href{https://github.com/NHERI-SimCenter/smelt}{GitHub repository}.

All input parameters can be specified as random variables by entering
a string in the parameter field. Please note that information for the
inputs that are identified as random variables needs to be provided in
the \texttt{UQ} tab.
