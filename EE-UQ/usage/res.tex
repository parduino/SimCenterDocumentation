When the user hits the Run button, and assuming the results are
successful. The results are presented here.  A successful run or
download of a job that ran successfully will result in 3 tabbed
widgets being displayed in the results panel.  The first tab, as shown in
\Cref{fig:results_summary}m shows summary statistics: mean and
stdDev values or min-max values (if discrete set is used to define one or more of the random variables, e.g multiple events)
are shown for each of the EDP's specified. The second panel,
shown in \Cref{fig:summary_information} shows the summary
information from Dakota output file containing other statstics generated by Dakota.

The third panel, shown in \Cref{fig:results_data} presents
graphically and in tabular form the results. By selecting different
columns with left and right mouse buttons in the table below the
graphic, the information in the graph is changed. Selecting the left
mouse button changes the Y axis, the right mouse changes the X
axis. If the same column is selected using both left and right keys,
the CDF and PDF is displayed. If last mouse press was with the left
button, the PDF and if right the CDF.
 
As for the columns in the table below the figure in the third panel. You will see a column for each random variable the workflow came across and then the columns for the response quantaties. There may be more than you specified if the applications the user selected bring additional random vraibles for the UQ engine to consider.
